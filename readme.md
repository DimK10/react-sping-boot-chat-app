## Basic template for a Chat Application with react and spring boot

To run the react part, run ```mvn clean install ``` the first time and for watching the js for React, run ```mvn frontend:npm@npm-run-watch```
so that webpack can compile and watch the changes made to js folder in com.kaitantzidis.chatapp package.

The project currently is mostly created by this article: https://medium.com/@rameez.s.shaikh/build-a-chat-application-using-spring-boot-websocket-rabbitmq-2b82c142f85a
which explains in a very concise way the setup for websockets with Spring Boot. 

In order to run the websockets part, please follow the instructions given from the author of the article above.
